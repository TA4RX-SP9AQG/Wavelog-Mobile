## Requirements

- Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher
- A self-hosted [Wavelog](https://github.com/wavelog/wavelog) instance **v3.2.0 or later**
- A **Wavelog API v2 token** (`wl2_…`) — generated in Wavelog → Settings → API Tokens

> **No server patch required.** Starting with v3.2.0 of Wavelog Mobile, all features run directly on the official Wavelog API v2. No files need to be uploaded to your server beyond a standard Wavelog installation.

### API Token Scopes

When creating the token in Wavelog under **Settings → API Tokens → New Token**, select these scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `confirmation:read` | LoTW / eQSL / QRZ.com confirmation status |
| `contest:read` / `contest:write` / `contest:delete` | Contest sessions |
| `logbook:read` / `logbook:write` / `logbook:delete` | Manage logbooks |
| `lookup:read` | Callsign lookup |
| `qso:read` / `qso:write` / `qso:delete` | Log and browse QSOs |
| `station:read` / `station:write` / `station:delete` | Manage station profiles |
| `statistic:read` | Statistics screen |

## Getting Started

1. Make sure your Wavelog server is at **v3.2.0 or later**
2. In Wavelog, go to **Settings → API Tokens** and create a new token with the scopes listed above
3. Install the app from Google Play
4. Open the app, enter your server URL and paste the API token
5. Select your station profile and start logging

The app will guide you through token creation on first launch.

## ADIF Import — Open With

On Android, `.adif` and `.adi` files are registered to open with Wavelog Mobile. Tap a file in your file manager or email client, select **Wavelog Mobile — İçe Aktar**, and the app opens directly on the import screen with the file pre-loaded. Select your station profile and tap **Import**.
